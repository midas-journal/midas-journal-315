This directory contains the source files for the Dijkstra's shortest path filter.

The folder Data contains the sample images and the desired shortest path results of our tests.

The folder Results is an empty folder which will hold the user's tests results.

The embedded tests write several configarations of shortests paths results (of the sample images) 
to the Results folder, and compares the results to the results in the Data folder.

In order to use this application you need to have the following software installed:
CMake 2.2 (or above)
Boost C++ library 1.36.0 (or above)
Insight Toolkit 2.4 (or above)
